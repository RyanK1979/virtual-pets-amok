# virtual-pets-amok
The culmination of the two prior pet projects.

1) In this one we add the ability to have multiple types of animals.
2) We have also addded the ability to have robots, and domesticated animals.
3) You can adopt, surrender, feed, water, walk, play with.
4) Sadly you still need to clean up there waste, but its better in a virtual world than in the real one.
5) Hopefully here shortly I will add some front end functionality to this project, that is the ultimate goal moving forward.

Thanks for checking out the project, hopefully you enjoy it.  It was definitely a positive learning experience for me!
